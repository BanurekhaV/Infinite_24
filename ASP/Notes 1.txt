-Web Form/A Web Page has code behind file and designer file
-Code behind file has an extension of .aspx.cs or .aspx.vb
-Designer file has an extensin of .aspx.designer.cs (auto generate d code and should not altered)
-A webform is associated with its code file using @page directive

-HTTP a stateless protocol

Page Life Cycle:
S : Start of the Page
I : Initialization (all controls are initialized)
L : Load
V : Validate
E : Event Handling
R : Render (CSS/Styles/UI is applied)


Page Events :
Pre-Init
Init
InitComplete
OnPreLoad
Load
LoadComplete
OnPreRender
Render
Unload

Trace : is like a debugger that traces all request and response activities of a page/es. In order to be able to trace we should enable the trace in web.config file as below

<system.web>
<trace enabled="true"/>

</system.web>

On enabling the trace, a file named trace.axd gets created for the application, using which we can track the events

Every Server control i.e asp: <controls> inherently will have a viewstate variable that will enable to manage the state of the page 

State of the Page (The current page with its values or data/info)

View State : is a variable of object type that need not be typecasted
 - Can store any data including UDT(user defined type)
 - It gets stored in the client application
