Deferred LINQ execution:
  -is a default way of execution
  - When we write a LINQ query, it doesnt execute by itself until
   we access the query results.
 - The execution is deferred until the query variable is iterated over in a foreach loop

Benefits of deferred execution :
 1. Avoid unnecessary execution and hence improves performance
 2. Query Construction and execution are decoupled
 3. A deferred execution query is reevaluated when we re enumerate the collection. Hence we always get the latest data
