Database Management System 

Database : can be defined as the the storage of inter related data that has been organized in such a fashion that retrieval of data is effective and efficient.

-A set of programs to access the data
-An Environment that is both convenient and efficient to use

Drawbacks of using file systems to store data :
 - Data redundancy and inconsistency
 - Difficulty in accessing the data
 - Data Isolation - multiple files and formats
 - Integrity Problems
 - Atomicity of updates 
 - Concurrent access by multiple users
 - Security problems


Levels of Architecture
  1. Physical : actual storage
  2. Logical : perceived data
  3. Application : specific data for specific users/applications (hiding)

DataModels : A collection of tools for describing
     1. Data
     2. Relationships
     3. Semantics
     4. Constraints

Types of DBMS
1.  Hierachial dbms  HDBMS
2.  Network dbms  NDBMS
3.  Relational dbms  RDBMS  (E-R Model)
4.  Object Relation dbms  ORDBMS (Multimedia, Hypertext based databases)

RDBMS : The relational model sorts the data into tables, also known as relations, whcih consists of rows and columns.

Important Terms in RDBMS:
 Relation - A table (rows and cols)
 Tuple - one row in a table
 Attribute  - a column in a table
 Degree  - number of attributes
 Cardinality - number of tuples
 Entity - anything that exists and is distinguishable
 Relationship - an association between entities

 Types of Reationships :
 - One to One : 
 - One to many : 
 - many to many : 

SQL - Structured Query Language (Case In-sensitive)
- DDL Data Definition Language (Create,Alter,Drop,Truncate) -Structure definition
- DML Data Manipulation Language (Insert,Update,Delete)
- DQL Data Query Language (Select)
- TCL Transaction Control Language (Commit, RollBack)
- DCL Data Control Language  (Grant, Revoke)

Super Key : In a given relation R, if K values are sufficient to identify a unique tuple, the K is a super key

Candidate Key :  When K values are minimal

Primary Key : A candidate key chosen as the principal means of identifying tuples in a relation.

Alternate Key : A candidate that is not the primary key, but has the potential to be one later.

Composite Key : A key that has more than one attribute in it 

Foreign Key : In a relational schema, an attribute in a relation that corresponds to the pk of another relation

Integrity Constraints:are rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures accuracy and reliability of the data in the database

  1. Domain Integrity Constraints : Type restrictions, length restrictions, data restrictions, range restrictions ( check, default)

  2. Entity Integrity Constraints : States that no primary key value be null, nor duplicates. It has to be unique (primary key, unique)

  3. Referential Integrity Constraints : Is specified between 2 relations and is used to maintain consistency among the tuples in both the relations . Every FK value must have a PK value reference in another table (Foreign Key)

Primary Key : The values have to be unique, cannot take null, or duplicates

Unique Key : The values have to be unique and non-duplicates, but can accomodate one null value

 
-Alter : adding and dropping a new column
         adding a column along with constraints (that work and that dont work)
Updation of one column or many columns with a restriction using 'where'
