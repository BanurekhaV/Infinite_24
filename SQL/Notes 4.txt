CTE : Common Table Expression : allows us to define a named temporary resultset that is available in the execution scope of statementsvix. select,insert,update and delete
- We can perform dml operations 
- We can multiple ctes seperated with a ',' and with a keyword 'with' to define a cte
- We can refer one cte within the other
- We can have recursive cte

syntax : with <ctename>(column list)
         as (cte definition), ctename as (select....)

      sql statements - main query

Advantages of ctes: Reusability
                 complex qieries can be broken down into different cte's 
                 more readable
                 does not occupy memory

Disadvantages : can be used only within the scope of sql statement/s and not others
                not supported by many database platforms

rank() - function when used with over() clause, defines a set of rows as results. 
         can also be used with partition to define subset of data
         can use order by clause to sort the results 
         skips rank number when it encounters a tie in values

dense_rank() - same as rank(), except that it will not skip any rank number even if there is a tie in data

Coalesce : a built-in function to handle null values in the data. It evaluates multiple input values and returns the first non-null value, after which it terminates
- acts like a shortcut alternative to lengthy case statements
- running 2 or more queries as a single query
- can be used for concatenation of column values as a single value

Rollup: extension to group by clause
        calculates sub totals and grand totals
