CTE : Common Table Expression : allows us to define a named temporary resultset that is available in the execution scope of statementsvix. select,insert,update and delete
- We can perform dml operations 
- We can multiple ctes seperated with a ',' and with a keyword 'with' to define a cte
- We can refer one cte within the other
- We can have recursive cte

syntax : with <ctename>(column list)
         as (cte definition), ctename as (select....)

      sql statements - main query

Advantages of ctes: Reusability
                 complex qieries can be broken down into different cte's 
                 more readable
                 does not occupy memory

Disadvantages : can be used only within the scope of sql statement/s and not others
                not supported by many database platforms
