Views : are virtual tables that do not have any data by themselves, and are dependent on the underlying table data
- There are objects in the relational schema (just the view definitions are stored)
- Used in providing security to the data.

syntax : create view <viewname> as 
select    .....

Indexes : are mechanisms of sorting the data physically within the database
 they are of 2 types
1. Clustered Index : It sorts the physical table itseld every time a DML operation is done
                - There can be only one clustered index per table
2. Non-Clustered Index : We can have many non-clustered index per table 
                - Creates a seperate Index table where the data is sorted
                - It occupies space 
                - Any dml manipulations does not affect the table but affects the index table(sorts)

The above 2 types can be either unique or non-unique 

3. Filtered Index : Is a non clustered index with a predicate. Used in situations where we need only some portion of the index


--Computed / Calculated columns
-- Date functions and conversions

--Stored Procedures : An query statement undergoes
   1. Parsing
   2. Execution Plan is created
   3. Plan is executed

- are saved sql statements along with the plan for execution(including parsing).
- can be reused
- they are faster in performance
- they are parsed once 

- we can simply call them and they execute
- They are stored as an object in the relational schema

--Procedures may or may not take arguments/parameters/input
--Procedures can take any number of arguments
--Procedures always have an integer return type
--Procedures can also return output values
