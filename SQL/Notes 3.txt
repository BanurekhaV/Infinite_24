-Enabling and disabling check constraints

-bulk insertion (invloves copying multiple rows at a time from one table to another, provided both the
    tables have the same no of columns and datatypes and also the order)

Hard Delete : deleting a row permanently

Soft Delete : not deleting but marking a remarks/status (non active, 'non-operation')

cascade delete or update (when a parent row is deleted/updared, all child references will also be deleted/updated))

Corelated subquery : is a query where one row of data for table is compared with each row against a related table. 
-It is used whenever a subquery must return a different result or set of results for each candidate row considered in the main query.
-can use all and any operators
-can use for deletion and updation as well
-inner queries are driven by the outer query value
-are dependent on th eouter query for its values
-they are executed repeatedly

--Case
  -simple case (with or without else):  case keyword is immediately followed by case expression and before when
                                        value exists for each when statement

  - searched case (with or without else): case keyword is followed by when statement. There is no expression between case and when
                                          boolean expression exists for each when statement

 - nested case : case within a case, case inside if else

Transact SQL : t-Sql

Variables : are of 2 types (1. Global Variables (@@), 2. Local variables (@))
-we can assign values to the local variables using set and select

-begin and end
-set and select
-select and print
-if and else
-case then
-while
-break and continue

ASCII - one character = 1 byte = 8 bits

UNICODE - one character=2 bytes=16 bits

Set Commands : are operators used to work with multiple tables
   -Union, Union all, intersect,except

Rules for using set operators :
 1. the result set of both queries must have same number of columns
 2. the datatypes of the columns of the both results set must be same
 3. the positional ordering of the column returned by the query must be same
 4. if we want to sort the final result, then the order by clause must be given at the end of the query

Union : removes duplicates occuring be concatenating 2 resultsets
union all : doe not remove duplicates

intersect : the common occurences are retrieved from the output of first query set and the 2nd query set

except : is the reverse of intersect
