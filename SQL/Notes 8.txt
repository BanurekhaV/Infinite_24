Normalization : is a process of decomposing a complex data structure to simpler ones.  This technique produces set of relations with desirable properties for the enterprise.

What if not normalized : We end up having redundant data thereby leading to 1.Insert Anomalies, 2. Update and 3 delete anomalies

We normalize using a concept called functional dependency

-describes the relationship between attributes in a relation

we have different normal forms

1. 1 Normal Form  - at every intersection of a row and a column, there should be precisely one and only one data
2. 2 nd NF : when all non prime attributes are fully functionally dependant on the whole key. Suggests removal of partial dependencies
3. 3rd NF : All non key attributes to be directly dependent on the determinant and not transitively. Transitive dependencies to be removed

BC NF
4th, 5th 6th nf

search window->run->services.msc->see if MSSQL server is running. If not you will get an error no.40. Simply start the services

File and Filegroups and growths:

Physical data is stored as datapages (data files)

Every database has atleast 2 operating system files : 1. data file, 2. log file

Data files can be either primary or secondary


-Every time we create a database, the system creates 2 files viz

1. Data file (.mdf) - primary file group (default)
2. A transactional log file (.ldf)

Multiple file groups : Help us to store data in a granular manner.
