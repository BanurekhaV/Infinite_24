Order By is used to sort the results of the select clause. It will not change the physical order
 - Default order is ascending, we can do a desc sort
 - Can sort on multiple columns seperated by a comma
 - We can order by on an alias column name
 - We can sort on a column not in the select list

Group by : allows to group the results on one or more columns to represent any group information
   - We can group on multiple columns 
   - We need to group on all the columns in the select list except for the aggregates
   - We cannot group on an alias column

query clause follows the below order:
select list
from
where   - place restriction on rows
group by - aggregate 
having  -- place restrictions on a group
order by -- 

Execution of the query follows the below order
from 
where
group

order by
select


selection/restriction - where
projection  column list comma seperated
joins
union
except
divide


Subquery : Query within a query
the main query is the final answer we need. But the main query depends on another query for its completion. This query will take a form of inner query and gets executed first. The result of the inner query is passed on to the main/outer query. the main/outer takes this as an input to complete the query

Guidelines for using subquery
 1. Enclose the subqueries in parenthesis
 2. Place subqueries on the right hand side of the comparison condition
 3. Use single-row operators with single-row subquery and multi-row operators with multi-row subqueries

Single-Row operators
    =, >, < ,>=, <=, <>,!=

select lower("SQL SERVER")

Multi-Row operators
   in, any, all
