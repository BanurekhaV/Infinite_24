Triggers : are used to create user defined constraints or Business Rules
 - They are like procedures or functions that can be reused, but unlike procedures/functions they are not called, but fired automatically, whenever ther is an event

Events : are either DDL or DML events

Triggers can be for DDL or DML events
Thet can be before/after, instead of triggers


triggers fire -> on an object --> when an event occurs

Magic tables get created during the scope of execution of the trigger body
   1. Inserted Table
   2. Deleted Table

Update events are always delete followed by insert 

--Instead of trigger : are triggers that fire and do something else than the actual event

syntax

create trigger <trigger name>
on <table|views
instead of insert,update,delete
as
begin
....
end

--DDL triggers . They are of 2 types
   1. Database Scoped DDL Trigger : Triggers created for specific activities for a particular database (databse level)

   2. Server Scoped DDL Trigger : at Server level (all databases of the server)
