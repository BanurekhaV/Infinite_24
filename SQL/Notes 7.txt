Triggers : are used to create user defined constraints or Business Rules
 - They are like procedures or functions that can be reused, but unlike procedures/functions they are not called, but fired automatically, whenever ther is an event

Events : are either DDL or DML events

Triggers can be for DDL or DML events
Thet can be before/after, instead of triggers


triggers fire -> on an object --> when an event occurs

Magic tables get created during the scope of execution of the trigger body
   1. Inserted Table
   2. Deleted Table

Update events are always delete followed by insert 

--Instead of trigger : are triggers that fire and do something else than the actual event

syntax

create trigger <trigger name>
on <table|views
instead of insert,update,delete
as
begin
....
end

--DDL triggers . They are of 2 types
   1. Database Scoped DDL Trigger : Triggers created for specific activities for a particular database (databse level)

   2. Server Scoped DDL Trigger : at Server level (all databases of the server)


Cursors: are objects that store the resultset of any query and allows traversal over tge rows

There are 2 types of cursors 1: Implicit cursor : are created by the database engine automatically and process it
                             2. Explicit cursor : User defined cursors that can be used to travel down the rows

Life Cycle :
   1. Declare a cursor
   2. Open the cursor
   3. Fetch data as long as there are rows
   4. Close the cursor
   5. Deallocate the cursor 


Forward only :We can only move forward from 1 st row to 2nd row like wise

Static : Cursors that do not reflect any updations made after opening the cursor

Dynamic : Opposite to static which allows us to see the updations after the cursor is opened 

Keyset : These cursors are driven by keysets of unique values
