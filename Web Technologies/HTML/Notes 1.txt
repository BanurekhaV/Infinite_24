WWW : 
Network of Information
  - A uniform naming scheme for locating resources on the web(URI)
  - Protocols, for access to the named resouces over the web (HTTP)
  - Hypertext, for easy navigation among the resources(HTML)

Every resource (Html document,images,videos,applications,programs)on the web has an address that may be accessed by a URI

Eg : http://www.mypage.com/mydir
   1. the protocol to access resource
   2. the name of the machine hosting the resource
   3. the name of the resource itself

 URI >(URN || URL)

Anatomy of a web page
 Html + CSS + Javascript = Content + Styles + Behaviours

HTMl is the Lifeblood of the www. 
CSS - No Plain HTMl, do it in style
Javascript : Gives behaviour to the html(data). Works behind the screen
     Validating user inputs
     Interactions with server based on the user actions

Web Site : front end interface through which the public interacts with the business online
    - is a like a foundation and can host several web applications
    - can have message boards, blogs, photo gallery, and many others

Web Application : services specific to a business needs. It integrates with the IT infrsatucture

Web Server : The actual infrastructure that hosts all the above 

W3C - A world wide web consortium was formed in the year 1994 by Time Lee. It aims at a way of standardising the protocols and technologies to build web contents

HTML : Is all about Tags/Elements and attributes and values

Semantic Tags : Tags that convey meaning to both the developers as well as the browser engine   <title><footer><address><strong>
       Non Semantic Tags : Tags that do not have any meaning  <div><span><b>

<span> element is like an inline, which usually can accomodate a small chunk of in-line html, whereas <div> element is a block-line used for large chunks of html code
