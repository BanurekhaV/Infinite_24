Viewbag, ViewData,TempData : are used to pass details/information from a controller to the view

ViewBag : Dynamic Datatype
 - is used to pass the data from controller to the view
 - has a shortlife, means once the data thru viewbag is passed on to the view from the controller, it becomes null.
 - this does not require any typecasting

Eg :

ViewBag.mydata="This is my data"
 and to access the same in the view
@ViewBag.mydata

ViewData:
 - is also used to pass info/data to the view from the controller
 - has a short life like viewbag
 - is a Dictionary Object deriving from ViewDataDictionary
 - uses a key value pair for storing and retrieving information
 - it requires typecasting for complex data

Eg:
 ViewData["mydata"]="This is my data"

and to access it in the view

 @ViewData["mydata"]


TempData : -Is used to transfer data/info from controller to view
- It internally uses Session to store the value
- We must check for null value before using tempdata in order to avoid runtime errors
- Requires typecasting
- Tempdata can be made alive for subsequent requests using a method called as TempData.Keep();
- Is also a dictionary object that stores data as a key value pair
- It is derived from TempDataDictionary
- Has a bigger life than ViewBag/ViewData
- Hence can be made available for 2-3 HTTP Requests
- Is used to transfer values from one controller to another
