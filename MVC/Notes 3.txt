Model Binding : Binding a model object/any object to the view

MVC With EF :

1. DB First Approach
    
HTTPGET : is a get request of a page from the server
HTTPPOST : is a post from the view to the controller and then server
HTTPPUT : is edit/update of view and then updations
HTTPDELETE : is a delete of information/record


Passing of data/information from view to the controller is 
 1. Object
 2. Forms Collection
 3. Parameter Collection
 4. Request Object
