Action Filters: Are pre-procecessing or post-processing logic in the Asp.net MVC Pipeline

-We can create custom action filters to manage any specific functionality before or after action methods calls, by inheriting from actionfilterattribute class
-



Model Binding : is a mechanism which converts the URL segment into method parameters
-Acts like a bridge between http request and the action method

Model binder uses a default modelbinder for mapping, and it follows below rule for mapping
 1. Request Form []- if request is a post request
 2. RouteData.Values[] - if value is in the route
 3. Request.QuerySyring[] - if the values are concatenated in the url (uname=?&pas=)
 4. Request.Files[] - if a file is being uploaded

In real life scenario, there will be need for custom binding, where the UI controls names and the model properties names do not match

- By implementing IModelBinder, we can do custom binding

title : Mr
fname : ABC
mname : PQR
lname : XYZ


Customer Name :Mr.ABCPQRXYZ
