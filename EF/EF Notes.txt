Entity Framework :

- It is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
- It is an open source framework for ADO.Net
- It helps developers to develop applications faster 

DBContext : is an instance of the database that represents all database objects, and groups any changes that has to be written back to the database as a unit

Types of Entities:

1. POCO Entities : (Plain Old CLR Object) A POCO entity is a class that does not depend on any framework base classes, but is just a normal .Net CLR class

2. Dynamic Proxy Entities :(POCO Proxy) Dynamic Proxy is a runtime proxy class which wraps the POCO entity

EF has 3 approaches to work with data

1. Database First Approach: (Existing Database) : Relations are simple mapped to classes as Models
2. Code First Approach: (New Database) : Classes get mapped to relations using migrations
3. Model First Approach:(Create models in design mode, then we convert them to classes, which are then mapped to relations)


Entity States : The Life cycle that describes the process in which an entity is created, deleted, modified. An entity is always in any of the following states

1. Added : The entity is marked as added, wehen we perform insertion. The entity will be tracked by the context, but the data will not be available yet in the database.

2. Deleted : The entity is marked as deleted. The entity will be tracked by the context and data exists in the database. When SaveChanges() is called, the entity is detached

3. Detached : The entity is not being tracked by the context. An entity will be in this state as soon as it is created using new operator

4. Modified : The entity is been modified. The entity is tracked and data exists in the database, and some or all property values have changed. After savechanges(), it is in unchanged state

5. Unchanged :  The entity either has been added or modified and saved.
