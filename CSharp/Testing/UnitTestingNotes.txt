  MbUnit

MSTest is a test environment that is included as a part of Visual studio.

- A single unit test will include a well known structure of Triple A's
  - Arrange  : Arrange all variables,objects etc

Example :

public void WhencallingAdd_itshould_sumupallvalues()
{
   //Arrange

  var expectedsum=10;

//Act
  var res=sum(a,b);
