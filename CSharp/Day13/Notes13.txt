Tuples : Is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different datatypes. Used when we need to hold an object with properties, without creating an object the same.
- When we need to return more than one value from a method as return values, then we can use tuples.

 Other options of returning more than one value from a method are :
  1. Custom Datatype   class custemp{name,doj,sal,mobile,prjdetails}
    custemp GetEmpData(){}
  2. Using Ref and Out : difficult to understand, and moreover ref and out are not supported with async methods
  3. Using dynamic : We can return multiple values using dynamic. Performance point of view we do not use dynamic

Nullable Types : 

Pattern Matching : a feature that allows testing an expression for the occurence of a given pattern . Allows operations like
  - type checking(type pattern)
  - null checking(constant pattern)
  - comparisons(relational pattern)
  - object deconstruction (positional pattern)
  - comparing values of properties(property pattern)
  - expression reuse(var pattern)
with minimal syntax

switch(expression)
{
  case pattern1 :

 ...
}

expression switch
{
pattern1 => val1,
pattern2 => val2,

..
patternN =>valN,
_ =>defaultVal
}
