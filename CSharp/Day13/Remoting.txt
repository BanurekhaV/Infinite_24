Remoting : Is a mechanism for communication, between objects of various applications that are not in the same process(Domain), nor in the same system
 - They may be using different transport protocols, Serialization format
 - Is a microsoft framework for communication between remote objects
 - Provides ways to hide various aspects of remote communication viz. managing connections, marshalling of data, reading writing xml/soap mesages
 - Provides services like
      - object activation
      - Life time support of objects
      - Communication channels
      - Transport message

Domain : When an application is loaded o to the memory, a process is created within that application. This is the application domain

Contexts : Application domain is divided into varoius contexts. A context is a set of common constraints,usage,access,functionalities within the object. 

Proxies : Is an instance of the remote object directly available to the client. It does all the marchalling across context and then forwards the request to the actual remote object

Marshalling : Specifies how a remote object is exposed to the client. The process of passing parameters from one context to another . There are 2 ways to marshal
   1. Marshal by Value  : the server creates a copy of the object and passes the copy to the client
   2. Marshal by Ref : the client creates a proxy for the object and then uses the proxy for further processing

Channels : is a mechanism that allows data transfers through a stream of bytes
        HttpChannel, TcpChannel

Types of Remote Objects : 
     1. Single Call : Objects that serve one request
     2. Singleton : Objects that serve multiple clients. One object that serves all the requests of the client. The server maintains the state of each client
     3. Client Activated Objects : Upon clients request for a remote object, the instance of the required object is activated, and the reference of the object is sent back to the client. A proxy object gets created at the client side. All calls will be executed on the proxy


Steps for Remoting
 - Class Library where all remote objects are created
 - Console Application - Server (Host for the Library)
 - Client Application 
Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
DCOM (Distributed COM)
Remoting  - replacement of DCOM
WebServices
WCF
API
