Visual Studio : IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
                Intellisense Support (using Reflection)

CSharp : Is a modern, general purpose object oreinted programming language by Microsoft
         Anders Hejlsberg and his team developed C# during Dot Net Framework Development

Namespaces : A Logical way to organize our programs
             It is a clolection of Classes,Interfaces,Events,Delegates,Structures,Enums, and also other Namespaces
             Helps in avoiding name clashes

Data Types : Are basically either
           a) Value Types - Types that have data directly (All primitive/systemic/fundamental datatypes- char,int,float,double,long,byte etc..)

  Ex: character c='a'( a variable c of character type holds a value 'a')

    Value Types are derived from System.ValueType
    Value type variables store the data
    Value types are allocated in stack memory

           b) Reference Types - Types that donot have data directly, instead have the reference to the location where data is (All objects of classes,interfaces,delegates,arrays etc.)
           - They are allocated in heap memory
           
   Ex :  string str; str="Hello";

Literals in C# :
  String - set of characters - Hello World
  Real - numbers with precision - 10.5
  Integer - numbers  - 1234
  Null   -- Unknown  or missing info  -  '/0'
  Boolean - true or false 
  Character - any one character - 'a' or '1'

Data/Type Conversions:

  Implicit Conversions : are conversions that are type safe
                         handled by the compiler automatically
                         smaller type to larger type 
    Example : integer data to float data
                         

  Explicit Conversions : are conversions done by users using predefind functions on conversion operators(cast)
                ToInt16(), ToInt32(), ToChar(), ToString(), etc...
                Parse(), tyrParse()
                cast- (datatype)
