WYSIWYG : 

OOP : Way of building applications/way of desiging an application

- Encapsulation : Unit of Information (data + methods/behaviours)
- Abstraction : Giving Required data and hiding not required data
- Inheritance : Possiblilities of extension of behaviour
                   single
                   multi level
- Polymorphism : Many Forms 
                  overloading
                  overriding

- all information resides inside a class

Class : is a user defined data type that encompases all the information required.

  Class is internal by default, but all the members of the class are Private by default
  
        
Object : Instance of a class with which we can use the information that is available inside the class

Static members are available as a single copy for the entire class. 
               Can be modified
               Maintained and managed by the CLR

Constructors : Are special functions of a class
               They are meant to allocate memory and initialize the members of the class
               They have the same name as that of the class
               They do not have any return types
               They can be overloaded (parameterized constructors)
               They have to be either public or internal
When a class does not have a constructor defined, then the framework supplies a default constructor

Destructors : is also a special function of the class
              It is meant for deallocation of the memory
              It also has the same name as that of the class prefixed with a '~'
              It cannot be overloaded
              It does not have any return type

Destructors are actually not needed to be specified inside the class, since the CLR manages automatic garbage collection and disposes off any unreferenced memory.
