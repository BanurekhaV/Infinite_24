sizeof() -- size of an type

typeof()  -- determines the data type

Readonly and constants

readonly variables in C#:
  It is declared using the keyword readonly
  The values of readonly variables cannot be modified, once it is initialized
  You can initialize the values for the readonly variable either at the time of declaration or in the constructor
  It behaves like a non-static variable , that is every object maintains a seperate copy, the only difference being that the readonly cannot be modifed, while the non-static variable can be


Constants : 
    Have to be initialized at the time of declaration itself
    The values cannot be modified.
    It is fixed for the entire class, comparable to static members
    The difference is, values in static members can be changed, but constants cannot be changed.

Inheritence:
  
    A class can derive from only one another class (No Multiple Inheritance)
    A Class can implement many interfaces
    The order of construction of objects is always from the base class to the derived class, and the destruction is opposite

Base Class Initialization thru the constructor of the child class id needed 
   when the parent/base class has only parameterized contructor

-base is a keyword to refer to a parent class
